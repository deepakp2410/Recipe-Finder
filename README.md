### Recipe Finder

Recipe Finder is a web application that allows users to search for recipes based on the ingredients they have at home. This project fetches data from the Spoonacular API to display various recipes with relevant details such as ingredients, steps, and images.

#### Features:
- Users can input ingredients to find related recipes.
- Recipe details include ingredients, instructions, and images.
- Responsive design optimized for various screen sizes.
- API integration using Spoonacular for fetching recipes based on user input.
- Ability to view detailed recipe information in a separate view.

#### Technologies Used:
- HTML for structuring the web pages.
- CSS for styling and creating a user-friendly interface.
- JavaScript for interaction and API handling.
- Spoonacular API for fetching recipe data.

#### Project Structure:
- `index.html` - The main page where users search for recipes.
- `recipe_details.html` - A detailed page that shows the full recipe, ingredients, and instructions.
- `styles.css` - The styling file for both the main page and the details page.
- `script.js` - JavaScript file that handles the search functionality and displays recipe results.
- `details.js` - JavaScript file for displaying detailed information about a selected recipe.

#### How to Use:
1. Open the project in a browser.
2. Enter the ingredients you have into the search bar (e.g., chicken, tomato).
3. Click the "Search Recipes" button.
4. View the displayed recipes and click on "View Recipe" for full details.
5. On the detailed view page, explore the ingredients and instructions.

#### API Key:
This project uses the Spoonacular API. To use the application, you need to replace the placeholder API key with your own Spoonacular API key in `script.js` and `details.js`.

#### Future Enhancements:
- Add functionality to save favorite recipes.
- Include filters for specific cuisines or dietary preferences.
- Improve error handling and loading indicators.# Recipe-Finder
